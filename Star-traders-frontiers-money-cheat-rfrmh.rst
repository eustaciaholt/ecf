Most profitable way of making money Is there anything that beats trading rare goods in terms of fastest cash? I have tried out using 9 xeno hunters and I can make about k with 9 weeks cooldown, but it seem macabre harvest is not supposed to be stacked and will be nerfed, so it's kind of exploitative.  · Star Traders: Frontiers v (Updated: 4/Aug/18) Post by gorsan» Fri pm this table also never worked for me even for right versions, i know mysql.  · Cheat engine ALWAYS works, you litterally can't build a game where it doesn't. Like Venom said however you can obfuscate the actual numbers vs the numbers displayed, the key in making it work is figure out the math that is used to change the display numbers. I'm sure table makers will do that in time. #2.
