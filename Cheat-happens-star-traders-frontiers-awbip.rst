 · I launched Star Traders via Plitch. Nothing happens when I attempt to use the cheats. It appears I should be able to activate with Num 0, then adjust xp with LShift F3, and credits with Num 7. Those keys do nothing, unless I'm on the map then Num 7 moves the map a bit. I've tried playing with NumLock settings.  · Disable any Live/Active/Real-Time tools which may trigger false positives in security software which may terminate the game/trainer when it's activated or options used. C:\Users\USERNAMEHERE\Cheathappens may need to be added to exclusions as well. Run trainer as admin, read the instructions and try again. Anti-virus help page.
