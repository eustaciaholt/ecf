 mod I haven’t played in a long time so just wondering if the mod is still playable because in my opinion it was just a hack and should be banned honestly. And if it isn’t, is there some way to play on servers that don’t use the mod? r/Snek. k members. The premiere Reddit community for all things snakes!

This a subreddit for  games such as agario, slitherio, and diepio. these hacks are getting just absolutely crazy and so unfair. Looks very distracting. Also it's not like you can't get the same info from a little zoom and experience. I have seen that before. I would not like all that crap moving around while I play.
